## About deltazeus

Unlike other weather app projects, deltazeus is different because it changes the way you are meant to review the weather.

Traditional weather apps require you to actively go to your weather app, look at the current data, and try to make a determination about what each data point means. Instead, deltazeus will send a notification to your preferred syndication (ie., email, RSS, push) _only_ when the change in weather is significant.

## History

This project first debuted in 2015 as a way for me to learn how to create a full stack application. Originally, the backend was created with PHP and MySQL, along with other server-side technologies like cronjobs.

In 2020, the stack was updated to use serverless.com through an AWS configuration. This allowed the majority of the backend to be written in JavaScript.

In 2025, the stack was updated again to rely on Netlify's infrastructure instead of getting lost within AWS configurations and cryptic system warnings.
